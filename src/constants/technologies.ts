        simultaneously, it can be a lot to digest.

        Even having worked with it for a while, there is still new stuff I
        discover. I've spent time working on my projects and building my React
        component library that CSS and I have become well acquianted, friends
        even -- albiet at arms length through Sass.`,

        I became much more acquianted with Python when we migrated all of our
        E2E testing at Qualtrics to use Python/Pytest instead of TS/Jest.

        I really enjoy using Python, but definitely prefer JS for most of

        Creating variables, mixins, and nesting tags is soooo nice, and has been
        helpful as I try to work on my design chops using CSS.

        catch errors before they sneak into production.

        I started using TypeScript at Qualtrics before we migrated our

        mmm... I love it.
