            Hey there, I&apos;m Spencer, a software developer with a foundation
            in software testing, which has helped me cultivate a user-centric
            approach to development.
          </p>
          <p>
            My career kicked off as a Software Test Engineer at Qualtrics, and
            my passion for coding led me to become a Full-Stack Developer,
            specializing in React and other modern web technologies.
          </p>
          <p>
            When I&apos;m not coding, you&apos;ll likely find me spending time
            with my wife and daughter, playing Magic: The Gathering or video
            games with friends, or attempting to stay active.
          </p>
